//--------------------------------
/*
/appointments/:id/edit: This route, associated with the EditAppointment component, indicates that you have a dedicated route for editing an appointment. The :id parameter might represent the ID of the appointment being edited.

In the EditAppointment component, you would typically fetch the appointment data based on the :id parameter from the URL and present a form or interface for users to update the appointment details. This separation of concerns makes your codebase cleaner and more maintainable.
