## Features

- **User Authentication:** Doctors, pharmacists, and healthcare practitioners can sign up and log in to access the application securely.
- **Patient Management:** Users can view patient records, add new patients, update patient information, and remove patients as needed.
- **Appointment Management:** Practitioners can schedule new appointments, update appointment details, and manage their patient's healthcare schedules.
- **Geolocation Integration:** Conveniently fetch patient locations for appointments using geolocation.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** Front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Ruby on Rails:** Back-end web application framework for handling server-side logic and database interactions.
- **PostgreSQL:** Relational database management system for storing patient and appointment data.
- **HTML/CSS:** Markup and styling for the user interface.
- **React Router:** Library for handling client-side routing in a React application.
- **Context API:** State management tool for sharing data across components.
- **Active Model Serializers:** Serialization library for converting ActiveRecord models to JSON.
- **bcrypt:** Library for hashing user passwords for secure authentication.
- **Geolocation API:** Integrating geolocation features for efficient appointment scheduling.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Open the application in your browser: `http://localhost:3000`

## Configuration

The project requires a Ruby on Rails server and a PostgreSQL database. Make sure you have Ruby, Rails, and PostgreSQL installed on your system.

1. Set up the database: `rails db:create` and `rails db:migrate`
2. Start the Rails server: `rails server`
3. Update the API endpoint in the React app: Open `src/api/index.js` and set the `baseURL` to match your Rails server URL.

## Folder Structure

- `/src`: Contains the main React application code.
  - `/components`: React components for different parts of the application.
  - `/context`: Context providers and consumers for managing application state.
  - `/api`: API configuration and utility functions for making requests to the server.
  - `/routes`: Defines the application routes using React Router.
  - `/assets`: Static assets such as images and stylesheets.
- `/server`: Contains the Ruby on Rails server code.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome! If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request. We invite healthcare practitioners, developers, and UI/UX designers to contribute to the project.
