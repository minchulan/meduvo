1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Open the application in your browser: `http://localhost:3000`

## Configuration

The project requires a Ruby on Rails server and a PostgreSQL database. Make sure you have Ruby, Rails, and PostgreSQL installed on your system.

1. Set up the database: `rails db:create` and `rails db:migrate`
